    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <p><b>WebAutomation.io:</b> The project consisted of many complex responsibilties which included setting
        up the Linux and Windows servers in the cloud - This included creating the necessary instances,
        configuring the necessary security settings, and installing the necessary packages. Configuring the
        autoscaling solution - This included setting up the necessary triggers, rules, and policies for the
        autoscaling solution. Deploying the necessary services - This included deploying the web server,
        database server, and other backend services that were necessary for the application. Configuring the
        necessary monitoring tools - This included setting up the necessary metrics, alarms, and notifications
        for the system. Running tests and validating the system - This included testing the system for
        performance, scalability, and other parameters. Implementing the necessary optimizations - This
        included optimizing the system for better performance and scalability. Troubleshooting and
        resolving any issues - This included troubleshooting and resolving any issues that arose during the
        implementation.</p>
    <p><b>Solana Labs:</b> Automation,Server Configuration,Time-Series Database,GITOPS
        I am responsible for setting up Time Series Metrics using InfluxDB. Setting it up in High
        Availability. Maintaining critical dashboards using Grafana and Prometheus stack. I am
        also responsible for managing a server pool which contains several thousand servers. In
        order to do so I used the following skills.
        <ul>
        <li>Since the servers were provided by a baremetal servers provider, I created several shell
        scripts which utilised the providers cli tool to perform various actions on several servers
        at once.</li>
        <li>In order to configure several servers at once I write several complex level ansible
        playbooks which can perform multiple tasks depending on the variables passed at the
        time of execution.</li>
        <li>In order to maintain uniform configuration of several critical services GitOps practices
        are followed to maintain uniform configuration across several servers at once.</li></ul></p>
        <p><b>Bluespice Mediawiki, Infrastructure,CI/CD,automation</b>
        <ul>
        <li>Provisioning of a High availability Kubernetes Cluster on a Bare-Metal Environment.</li>
        <li>Setup cluster level automations.</li>
        <li>Setting up CI/CD using Gitlab for automatic deployments on the kubernetes cluster.</li>
        <li>Ensured best practices by using vault to store and retrieve valuable secrets for CI/CD
        executions.</li>
        <li>Setting up alerts, monitoring, and visualisation using prometheus Grafana stack.</li>
        <li>Migration of existing infra on docker swarm to kubernetes infra.</li></ul></p>
